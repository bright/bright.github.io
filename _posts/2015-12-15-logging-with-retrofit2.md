Retrofit has been updated to 2.0 version.<br/>
It's a major change in the one of the most popular library for Android platform.</br>
A lot of things have been changed out there but in this blog post I want to cover how to setup logging properly.

# Retrofit 1.x - old way
In Retrofit 1.x we just call:
{% highlight java %}
	adapter.setLogLevel(RestAdapter.LogLevel.FULL)
{% endhighlight %}

# Retrofit 2.x - new way
In Retrofit 2 you should use [HttpLoggingInterceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/logging/HttpLoggingInterceptor.java).

Add dependency to `build.gradle`:

{% highlight groovy %}
compile 'com.squareup.okhttp:logging-interceptor:2.6.0'
{% endhighlight %}

Create `Retrofit` object like follow:

{% highlight java %}
	OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();
	HttpLoggingInterceptor interceptor = new HttpLoggingInterceptor();
	interceptor.setLevel(HttpLoggingInterceptor.Level.BODY);
	client.interceptors().add(interceptor);

	Retrofit retrofit = new Retrofit.Builder()
	        .baseUrl("https://backend.example.com")
	        .client(client)
	        .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
	        .build();


	return retrofit.create(ApiClient.class);
{% endhighlight %}
`RetrofitAdapter` dosen't exsist any longer, we have `Retrofit` class instead. <br/>
The big change is that [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/) is required now and set as dependency for Retrofit.<br/>
The instance of `OkHttpClient` is the place where you should set up logging.

Retrofit has a dependency to OkHttp version 2.5.0, but I've tested it with LoggingIntenceptor version 2.6.0 and it works well.

It should print logs similar to the old ones from Retrofit 1.x.<br />
Hope it helps you :)
