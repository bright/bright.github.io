On Thursday 18th December 2014 I gave a small presentation about [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) to the local [Cocoaheads Tricity](https://www.facebook.com/CocoaHeadsTricity) group. [Cocoaheads](http://cocoaheads.org/) is a group of passionate iOS and MacOS X developers willing to share their knowledge and learn.

If you've never heard of ReactiveCocoa the presentation might plant a seed of interest:

It's probably not easy to get started thinking in [FRP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) terms to get most out of ReactiveCocoa - but once you do, using the library is a pleasant experience.
