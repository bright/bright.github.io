In my previous post I wrote about adopting UIApplicationShortcutItems in your app. Now it's time to implement Peak&Pop - a feature provided by 3d Touch.

## Get started

First of all we need to check if our device supports force touch events. Then if our device is familiar with force touch we can easily register our `UIViewController` for force touch events. Take a look at this snippet:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/k8mil/a08f80ddcc3f064a881650cc2dafc1eb.js"></script>

As you can see the above code uses the `traitCollection` property. It is available in every `UIViewController` and provides information about controller environment. In documentation we can read about it:

>A trait collection encapsulates the system traits of an interface's environment

So when we access `traitCollection` and get information about `forceTouchCapability`. It will return one of these values:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/k8mil/6f1cc95592658e495ef6a39b5e6df153.js"></script>

Another method that needs some attention is `registerForPreviewing`. It register `UIViewController` for force touch events. Documentation:

> Registers a view controller to participate with 3D Touch preview (peek) and commit (pop).

There is also `unregisterForPreviewing(withContext previewing: UIViewControllerPreviewing)` function available. After unregistering, all features related to 3d Touch will be turned off for view controller that called `unregisterForPreviewing` method.

## All registered, what's next?

We should take a look on `UIViewControllerPreviewingDelegate` - this delegate class is responsible for handling events from 3d Touch in view controller that implements methods of this delegate.

There are two methods:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/k8mil/aff420c55492b809990e170dedddaade.js"></script>

First method is responsible for catching force-touch events. For example if you firmly press some view in `UIViewController`, that conform to `UIViewControllerPreviewingDelegate`, the method will be called once until you release your finger or press more strongly the view. As you can see this method returns an optional `UIViewController?`. The controller returned from this function is used for action called Peek. There is also a second parameter named `location` it will give you an information about at what `CGPoint` in ViewController's view, the app received force touch. Here you can see what the Peak looks like:

</p>

Second method is responsible for an event called Pop. When the 3d touch mechanism detects that you strongly pressed the `ViewController` that was returned from `viewControllerForLocation` method, it will call and pass that `UIViewController` as `viewControllerToCommit` to second
`previewingContext(_ previewingContext: UIViewControllerPreviewing, commit viewControllerToCommit: UIViewController)` function.

> Important thing is that when the `viewControllerForLocation` returns `nil` the second function `viewControllerToCommit` will be not called.

In this method we can present `viewControllerToCommit` or do another actions e.g animate touched view.

## Implementation

Let's imagine that you have `UIViewController` that contains two `UIImageViews` with beautiful apple images inside.
For this controller we want to implement 3d Touch Peak&Pop feature.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k8mil/k8mil.github.io/master/assets/posts/3dTouch/view_controller.png"/>
</p>

In `viewDidLoad()` function, register our controller for force touch events.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/k8mil/ab027712bcc2355293a589326d53dcbf.js"></script>

Create and add the `UIImageViews` to the array named `forceTouchableViews`. In my implementation I created `AppleImageView` class that inherits from `UIImageView` and have a `appleDescription` property.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/k8mil/fee49ab346af7b034d944ee4a1185034.js"></script>

You might be wondering why the `forceTouchableViews` is needed. But keep calm and continue reading, I will get back to it later :-).   


Now let's create an extension for our `UIViewController` that will conform to `UIViewControllerPreviewingDelegate`

<script src="https://gist.github.com/k8mil/9d61c4893dad27b18276311ccb3b0cb1.js"></script>

> For my purposes I created an Apple model class that holds name and image property. Also I created AppleDescriptionViewController which will be responsible for representing the `viewControllerToCommit` parameter.

## About the code

As you can see in `viewControllerForLocation` method, I iterate through my `forceTouchableViews` and check using `wasTouched(in: location)` function, if some of views was touched. If no view was touched the function will return nil.
Ok, but what that `wasTouched(in: location)` function does?

<script src="https://gist.github.com/k8mil/c63284cf2b098fd0906c24583a718040.js"></script>

It converts input point to location in superview(if exist) and then checks if that location is inside UIView's bounds. If yes then it will return `true` and we can say that our view was touched.

If I determine that some of my apple image views was touched, then I create a `AppleDescriptionViewController` and return it.

The only thing just left is to press a little bit harder on our apple image view and we will get into last step. The body of that function is simple as follow:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/k8mil/765e20cc3d9734e2edab387ea7b5d1a9.js"></script>

## Result

</p>

pretty nice, huh?

## Conclusion

I don't like the way to determine what view user touched. Checking a point and calculating location for that is not really nice. Maybe another, better way to implementing 3d touch mechanism for views could be: extending a `UIView` class by some property like `3dTouchGestureRecognizerDelegate` then implementing some methods like in `UIViewControllerPreviewingDelegate`. Then we don't have to check whether view was touched, because on the delegate methods the touched view could be passed as method parameter. Something familiar to `gestureRecognizer`. Maybe in future iOS updates the API will be changed?
To sum up, `UIViewControllerPreviewing` allows us the create pretty nice features and I highly recommend to use that and make your application better!

The whole implementation with example app you can find in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/k8mil/3dTouchPeak-Pop) .

Thanks for reading, and see you soon!
