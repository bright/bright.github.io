On Tuesday 31th March 2015 I gave a presentation about most popular Cocoa libraries and [CocoaPods] (http://cocoapods.org) at the local [Cocoaheads Tricity](https://www.facebook.com/CocoaHeadsTricity) group meeting, which we are now co-organizing. 

If you have ever wondered what libraries we use at Bright Inventions or you didn't know that you can divide your app into private Pods you may find this presentation interesting.

If you are interested in Apple technologies we invite you to [Cocoaheads Tricity](https://www.facebook.com/CocoaHeadsTricity) meetings where we talk and learn about Cocoa, Swift, Objective-C, UX/UI design and everything else related to creating apps on this platform.
