On Tuesday 31th March 2015 I performed a presentation about most popular Cocoa libraries and [CocoaPods] (http://cocoapods.org) on the local [Cocoaheads Tricity](https://www.facebook.com/CocoaHeadsTricity) group meeting, which we are now co-organizing. 

If you have ever wondered, what libraries we are using at Bright Inventions, or you didn't know, that you can divide your app into private Pods you may find this presentation interesting.

If you are interested in Apple technologies we invite you to [Cocoaheads Tricity](https://www.facebook.com/CocoaHeadsTricity) meetings, we talk and learn about Cocoa, Swift, Objective-C, UX/UI design and everything else related to creating apps for this platform.
